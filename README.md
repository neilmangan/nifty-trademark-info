## What's a NIFTY?

A NIFTY (or NFTy) is a common term within the blockchain community that refers to a non-fungible token (an "NFT"). It is phonetic way to refer to an NFT. 

## Is the word NIFTY trademarked for use in the blockchain marketplace?

In July of 2018, Dapper Labs Inc., the creator of popular **CryptoKitties** NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain, applied to the [**United States Patent and Trademark Office**](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=88046182&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch) and the [**Canadian Intellectual Property Office**](http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/viewTrademark?id=1909994&tab=reg&lang=eng) to trademark the term **"NIFTY"** for use with products and services related to a variety of uses, including:

- downloadable computer software to enable consumers and businesses to interact with other software, digital assets, digital apparel, cryptocurrency, online services, and databases; 
- computer application software for mobile phones, portable media players, and computers that is used to enable users to hold cryptocurrency via electronic wallets; 
- computer software to create and manage electronic wallets for holding cryptocurrency; 
- application software, namely, software for sending, receiving, buying, selling and storing cryptocurrency;
- software for use in accessing, reading, tracking, and using blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, digital assets, and digital apparel; 
- software for facilitating a cryptocurrency transaction

In August of 2018, it came to light within the NFT and blockchain communities that Dapper Labs Inc. had filed this trademark application. The NFT and blockchain community - which relies heavily on open source software and community contributions - was upset that Dapper Labs Inc.'s had filed and application to seize control of the word Nifty.
